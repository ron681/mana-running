# READY TO START: SCHOOLS PAGE IMPLEMENTATION

## Documentation Status âœ…

All documentation has been updated and committed locally:
- Auth migration marked complete
- Multiple client warning documented in Technical Debt
- Roadmap updated with completed items

**Next:** Push to GitHub (see commands below)

---

## What We're Building

### Phase 1: Navigation & Athletes List (Start Here)

**Goal:** Set up the Schools page structure with navigation tabs

**Pages to Create:**
1. Navigation tabs (in layout)
2. Athletes list page (`/schools/[id]/athletes`)
3. Individual athlete page (`/schools/[id]/athletes/[athleteId]`)

**Reference:** See `IMPLEMENTATION_STARTER_GUIDE.md` (already downloaded)

---

## Push Documentation First

```bash
cd mana-running
git push origin main
```

This pushes 2 commits:
1. Schools page roadmap + Team Selection fix
2. Auth migration completion + Tech debt update

---

## Start Implementation

### Option A: Follow the Step-by-Step Guide

Use the **IMPLEMENTATION_STARTER_GUIDE.md** file I created earlier:
- Complete file structure diagrams
- Full code for each file
- Step-by-step testing instructions
- Common issues & solutions

### Option B: I Walk You Through It

Tell me when you're ready and I'll:
1. Create the layout file with navigation tabs
2. Build the Athletes list page
3. Create individual athlete pages
4. One step at a time with testing

---

## Quick Reminder: What You're Building

### Navigation Tabs (All School Pages)
```
Overview | Athletes | School Records | Season History
```

### Athletes Page
- List all athletes (boys/girls separated)
- Show class year and race count
- Click to view individual athlete

### Individual Athlete Page
- Race history table
- Performance chart (later)
- Course PRs (later)
- Improvement metrics (later)
