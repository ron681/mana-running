# MANA RUNNING - STATUS UPDATE

## Documentation Location ✅

**CONFIRMED: Single Source of Truth**

Your documentation is in **ONE PLACE ONLY:**

```
GitHub Repository: ron681/mana-running
Location: /docs/ folder
URL: https://github.com/ron681/mana-running/tree/main/docs
```

**Files in /docs:**
- DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md
- MANA_RUNNING_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md
- QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- MANA_RUNNING_ROADMAP.md
- SCHOOLS_PAGE_ROADMAP.md (NEW - just created)
- Plus several other specialized docs

**No Google Drive documentation exists** - I searched and found nothing.

**No backup locations** - GitHub is the single source.

## Recent Progress Updated ✅

### What Was Accomplished (October 9, 2025)

**Team Selection Table Fixed:**
- **Issue:** No athletes displaying after course_id was moved from meets to races table
- **Fix:** Updated query in `/src/app/schools/[id]/team-selection/page.tsx`
- **Result:** Team Selection now shows athletes for all seasons correctly
- **Query Structure:** Results → Races → Courses/Meets (proper foreign key traversal)

This fix has been documented in:
- IMMEDIATE_ACTION_ITEMS.md (added to completed items)
- MANA_RUNNING_ROADMAP.md (added to completed features)

## What Needs to Happen Now

Documentation changes are committed locally but **NOT yet on GitHub**.

**You need to push:**
```bash
cd /path/to/mana-running
git push origin main
```

See the deployment guide for detailed instructions.

### Step 2: Review Schools Page Roadmap

**File:** `/docs/SCHOOLS_PAGE_ROADMAP.md`

This has everything you need:
- Feature specifications

- Implementation phases
- Technical requirements

### Step 3: Start Implementation

**Suggested Order:**

## Addressing Your Concerns

**Answer:** Only ONE place exists - GitHub `/docs/` folder. No other locations to worry about.

### ❓ "It is fine if there is a backup"

**Answer:** No backup needed. Git provides version history. Every change is tracked.

## Section Titles - Comparison

### What You Have Now:
- Athletes
- Records & PRs
- Season History
- Team Selection

### What I Recommend:
- **Athletes** ✅ Keep this - good name
- **School Records** (instead of "Records & PRs") - clearer for users
- **Season History** ✅ Keep this - good name
- Move "Team Selection" as a tab INSIDE Season History

### Why This Structure?

1. **Athletes** - Individual focus, progression tracking
2. **School Records** - All-time bests, team records, Top 10s
3. **Season History** - Season-specific data including:
   - Races run
   - Team Selection (tab)
   - Most Improved (tab)

This matches what sites like xcstats.com use and is intuitive for coaches.
